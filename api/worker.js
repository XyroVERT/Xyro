/**
 * Xyro API - a thin, owner-controlled front door in front of the repo and the
 * database. Deploy it on Cloudflare Workers (free tier: 100k requests/day, no
 * card). See api/README.md for the setup walkthrough.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * Before this, every client talked to these hosts directly:
 *   - raw.githubusercontent.com / cdn.jsdelivr.net  -> config files
 *   - <your-db>.firebaseio.com                      -> staff list, command
 *                                                      queue, presence
 * That means the database URL (and any ?auth= secret) shipped inside a public
 * script, and the database rules had to stay open enough for anonymous clients
 * to read and write. Here the secret lives in a Cloudflare environment variable
 * that no client ever sees, so the rules can be closed to the public and only
 * this Worker keeps access.
 *
 * Two route families
 * ------------------
 * 1. DATABASE-SHAPED routes - byte-for-byte the same paths the Realtime Database
 *    REST API serves, so pointing xyro.lua at this Worker required no logic
 *    change (the script builds "<base>/cmd.json" and friends):
 *      GET    /staff.json
 *      GET    /cmd.json                      (stale entries pruned server-side)
 *      PUT    /cmd/<key>.json                (key required)
 *      DELETE /cmd/<key>.json                (key required)
 *      GET    /here.json                     (stale beats filtered out)
 *      PUT    /here/<key>.json               (key required)
 *      DELETE /here/<key>.json               (key required)
 *    Only these three nodes are proxied. The Worker is deliberately NOT a
 *    generic database proxy: anything else in the database stays unreachable.
 *
 * 2. NAMETAG routes - the tag system hosted here instead of on GitHub's CDN:
 *      GET    /nametags                      -> the published tag rules
 *      GET    /nametags.json, /config        -> aliases for the same bytes
 *      GET    /media/<file>                  -> seals, verified badge, artwork
 *      POST   /media/<file>                  (owner key + GH_TOKEN) store artwork
 *      PUT    /nametags                      (publish key) publish them
 *      POST   /nametags/check                (owner key) can this Worker publish?
 *    The rules are public and ungated on purpose (the editor has no key, and
 *    the file is public in the repo anyway); publishing is owner-only, and a
 *    stale editor can send ?sha= so GitHub rejects it rather than clobbering a
 *    newer revision.
 *
 * 3. FRIENDLY routes for the site, the Discord bot and humans:
 *      GET    /                               -> status page for humans
 *      GET    /health                        -> config self-report (JSON)
 *      GET    /version                       -> version.txt from the repo
 *      GET    /staff                         -> the staff object
 *      GET    /blacklist                     -> just the blacklist map
 *      POST   /blacklist/<who>               (key required) body = reason text
 *      DELETE /blacklist/<who>               (key required) *   GET    /online                        -> { count, online[], beats{} }
 *
 * Auth - TWO keys, deliberately
 * ----------------------------
 * Send a key as the `x-api-key` header, or `?key=` when the caller can only do
 * a plain GET (executors' game:HttpGet cannot set headers).
 *
 *   XYRO_KEY        the CLIENT key. Ships to every script user (it is in
 *                   api.json in a public repo, so treat it as public). It may
 *                   read, heartbeat, and enqueue commands - nothing else.
 *   XYRO_ADMIN_KEY  the OWNER key. Held only by you and your Discord bot. It is
 *                   required to write the blacklist and to trip the kill switch
 *                   (and that switch also needs a database credential - see the
 *                   bottom of this comment).
 *
 * The split matters: with a single key, the key inside the Lua client would also
 * authorize blacklisting a rival. Two keys mean the thing every player can
 * extract cannot do anything dangerous.
 *
 *   - reads are gated only when XYRO_KEY is set (the data is public anyway;
 *           gating it costs nothing and stops casual scraping of the DB)
 *   - admin writes FAIL CLOSED: with no XYRO_ADMIN_KEY configured they return
 *           503 rather than silently accepting anonymous writes
 *
 * A client key is not a secret - it is a speed bump. What it buys is that the
 * *database credential* never leaves this Worker, so a leaked key gets rotated
 * in one command and the rules stay shut.
 *
 * The kill switch
 * ---------------
 * `staff/gate` in the database is a remote control read by the loader and by
 * every running client:
 *
 *   { "enabled": false, "message": "down for maintenance" }
 *
 *   GET  /gate             -> the current gate (defaults to enabled)
 *   GET  /staff/gate.json  -> same thing, database-shaped, for the script
 *   POST /gate             -> admin key; body {enabled, message, warn}
 *   POST /gate/off         -> admin key; body is the message shown on screen
 *   POST /gate/on          -> admin key
 *   GET  /script           -> the script itself; 403 while the gate is off
 *   GET  /loader           -> the loader you hand out; 403 while the gate is off
 *
 * A gate that cannot be read fails OPEN (enabled), because a database hiccup
 * must never take the script away from everyone at once.
 *
 * Writing the gate is the one thing this Worker cannot do anonymously: the
 * database rules allow reads but refuse writes to `staff`. So POST /gate needs
 * a database credential of its own - FB_SERVICE_ACCOUNT (preferred), the split
 * FB_CLIENT_EMAIL + FB_PRIVATE_KEY, or the legacy FB_SECRET. Without one the
 * route answers 403 and says exactly that, and `npx wrangler deploy` is not the
 * fix - the credential is. See api/README.md section 4.
